# Data Engineering Documentation

This directory contains supporting documents used during the development of the Smart City IoT data pipeline. Each file provides essential context for designing the Business Database (3NF), Data Warehouse (Star Schema), and SCD Type 2 logic.

## 📄 Document Descriptions

### 1. Objektbeschreibung.pdf
High-level description of the Smart City IoT scenario, including sensors, data sources, and the overall project environment.

### 2. Projektbeschreibung_SmartCityIoT.pdf
Formal project description defining objectives, requirements, stakeholders, and expected outcomes.

### 3. Tabellen für Speicherberechnung.pdf
Storage estimation calculations for fact and dimension tables, including growth projections.

### 4. Normalization.pdf
Documentation of the normalization steps applied to transform the raw dataset into a 3NF business database schema.

### 5. DWH_fragen.pdf
Key analytical questions and BI requirements used to design the Data Warehouse and define fact/dimension structures.

### 6. SCD_IOT.pdf
Explanation of the Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Type 2) strategy implemented for historical tracking of entity changes.
